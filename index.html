    <h1>My name is Frank Queralta</h1>

    <p>
        I am passionate about video games and love spending time exploring different game worlds.  
        Whether it's action, strategy, or adventure games, I enjoy the challenge and excitement they bring.  
        I also have a huge sweet toothâ€”candy is my weakness! From chocolate to gummies, I can never say no to a good treat.
